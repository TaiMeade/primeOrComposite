This program uses Rust to determine if a number is prime, or composite.  If it is composite, then it will also list out every factor of that number.  

It initially started out unoptimized, but was optimized in order to receive extra credit on the project.  This version is intended to handle positive integers up to 10^18 and composite numbers with up to 10000 factors.

It can easily handle a dozen numbers meeting these cases in just a few seconds.  The code itself is in main.rs, and the .txt files were used for testing purposes.
